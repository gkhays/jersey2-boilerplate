# jersey2-boilerplate

A minimalistic boilerplate application for a RESTful Jersey 2 application. Dependencies managed with Maven. This project serves as a starting point for beginning a Jersey 2 project. Although it is possible to create a Jersey project from scratch, using Maven and Eclipse, it is a multi-step process and will lead to a similar structure as found here.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://git.idmapps.nqbuild.lab:3000/haysg/jersey2-boilerplate.git
```

Update `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`

Modify `SimplePojo.java` and `SimpleResource.java` to reflect your application.
